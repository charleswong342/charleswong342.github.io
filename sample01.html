            <h1>Web Design Fundamentals</h1>
            <p>
                Web design is as much a science as it is an art form. While half of the job is based on sound coding and design know-how, the other half is based on just having an intuitive sense of what looks good and what doesnâ€™t. Any web designer worth his salt will develop a strong core of fundamentals to make himself stand out from the rest of the pack.
